Theme/Story: 
The project is inspired by childhood bakery inspired games, such as Papa’s Cupcakeria or Purple Place. We wanted to create an interactive cake-decorating application where users can use their creativity to customize a cake to their liking. The project is a combination of an animation as well as a game. When the user selects the “flavor” of the cake, the project starts, and shortly after, the pan with the cake batter is placed in the oven where the user can watch the cake bake. Inside the oven, the batter is rising in level, but as it is difficult to see, we implement the movement of the coals in the oven for a more visually appealing effect. After the oven scene, the user is taken to a marble table where they see the cake on a plate. There, the user can select which frosting color they want, as well as their toppings. If the user chooses to light their candle, they are met with a swaying flame! After, if they select “done”, a pop of confetti appears on their screen along with the audio celebrating the creation of their cake! 

How Cake Craft Works:
Camera: 
For all three scenes (batter, baking, and decoration), the user can move the camera around to get to different perspectives of the cake-making process.

User Controls:
Mouse and Keyboard Inputs: Players use the mouse or keyboard inputs to select cake features such as flavor, frosting color, and toppings. The arrow keys or WASD keys can be used to help navigate through different scenes. 

Game Progression:
Selecting Cake Batter Flavor: The cake simulation begins when the user selects a cake flavor.
Baking Scene: The pan with the user selected batter is placed in the oven, allowing users to watch the cake rise. The effect is enhanced by the visually engaging movement of glowing coals within the oven. 
Decoration Scene: The cake is presented on a plate on top of a marble table, where users can customize their cake with a variety of frostings and toppings. Additionally, a candle topping can also be placed on the cake, and when lit, it features a charming swaying flame animation. 
Completion: Selection “Done!” triggers a confetti animation and a celebratory audio.

Sound Effects:
Background music plays  when the user begins the cake simulation, with an option to turn it off if desired. There is also a congratulatory audio that plays when the user completes their cake decoration.
